## Project Overview
This project focuses on clustering Google reviews to discover patterns and group similar reviews together. We use machine learning techniques to perform unsupervised clustering on review text data, aiming to identify key themes and sentiments in the reviews.

## Data Description
The primary data source for this project is a collection of Google reviews, typically in a CSV or JSON format. Key features in the review data include:

- `review_id`
- `review_text`
- `rating`
- `timestamp`
- `user_id`
- `business_id`

## Installation
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/dhruv-atreya/google-review-clustering-project.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd google-review-clustering-project
   ```
3. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
4. Install the required packages:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have the review data file in the project directory.
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook ML_project_19_H_clustering_google_review.ipynb
   ```
3. Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess the data, perform clustering analysis, and visualize the results.

## Clustering Analysis
The project includes various clustering techniques to group similar reviews. Key steps include:

- Data Preprocessing
- Text Vectorization (e.g., TF-IDF)
- Dimensionality Reduction (e.g., PCA)
- Clustering Algorithms (e.g., K-means, DBSCAN)

## Results
The results of the clustering analysis are documented within the Jupyter Notebook. Key findings include:

- Identified clusters of reviews with similar themes
- Visualization of clusters
- Insights into common sentiments and topics in reviews
